                <p><span class="ui text large">Marvin is an AI powered tool for stylistic language editing.
                        It leverages a
                        combination of recent Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning innovations in text
                        classification and generation as well as visualization and interpretation techniques. Marvin
                        provides the ability to classify the style of texts, transfer to other styles as well as
                        understand
                        how certain features contribute to style. It strives to adhere to a machine-in-the-loop
                        framework,
                        where writing is performed largely by human users, but is aided by algorithmic
                        suggestions.</span></p>

                <p><span class="ui text large">We evaluated the machine learning models that comprise Marvin on several
                        benchmark
                        metrics and
                        determined that these models are able to perform well on linguistic style tasks. One of Marvin’s
                        primary novel contributions is the ability to transfer to different specific levels of a
                        particular
                        style. It also can perform joint style analysis and transfer for several dimensions of style
                        simultaneously.</span></p>

                <p><span class="ui text large">At the School of Information we find ourselves at the intersection of
                        cutting
                        edge
                        research and a
                        will to democratize access to such research. Throughout history, the written word has played a
                        vital
                        role in expanding the horizons of human consciousness. And effective use of stylistic language
                        is
                        ubiquitous in this pursuit, from scientific text and Wikipedia to the writings of Shakespeare
                        and
                        Mahatma Gandhi. Unfortunately, language famously suffers from issues of bias, accessibility and
                        quality control. Anyone who has ever made a Wikipedia edit or has written a technical blog post
                        immediately recollects the dozens of examples one has to pore over, to emulate the style,
                        objectivity and tenor of the writing style. Adherence to a particular style can often be used as
                        a
                        proxy measure of value. At best, this leads to a high variance in quality, and at worst, it
                        makes
                        the process of writing entirely prohibitive to newcomers. We believe that a system, such as
                        Marvin,
                        will help users generate style-conformant content and can democratize access to domains for
                        fledgling writers from various backgrounds.</span></p>

                        The primary goal of Marvin is to help people write style-conformant content. We do this in two
                        ways. Firstly, we give users analysis on their sentences so that users themselves can write
                        better content. Secondly, we provide suggestions for transfer into a target style while
                        retaining the semantic meaning of the sentence.
