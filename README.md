[Marvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_the_Paranoid_Android) is a style translator. It's the next generation of writing aids. Marvin is [Clippy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant), after graduating from college. We're building Marvin for all the hitchhikers, out there in the galaxy. Don't panic! 

This is part of the MIMS capstone project by Daniel, Priyam and Vivek, advised by Marti Hearst and Dongyeop Kang.
